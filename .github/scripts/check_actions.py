"""Structural validation for every composite action in this repo.

There is no test suite here and nothing else runs before a consumer does. A
malformed `action.yml` is not caught at author time or at review time -- it is
caught when someone else's deploy job fails to start, in their repo, on their
merge. These checks are the cheapest possible stand-in for that: they run in
seconds and catch the class of mistake that breaks every consumer at once.

Shell bodies are extracted here rather than shellchecked in place because
`action.yml` is YAML: shellcheck cannot see a `run:` block until something
pulls it out and gives it a shebang.
