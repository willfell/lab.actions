# lab.actions

Composite GitHub Actions shared across the homelab's projects.

Public on purpose: composite actions are YAML wrappers and every credential is
passed in as an input, so there is nothing secret here — and a public repo
avoids the private-repo Access setting that otherwise has to be right in every
consuming repository.

| Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `lab-build` | Compute semver, build, push an immutable tag, move a mutable environment pointer, cut a release |
| `lab-deploy` | Point an Argo CD Application at a new image and wait for it to converge |

Consume at a tag, never at `main`:

```yaml
- uses: willfell/lab.actions/lab-build@v1
```
